##Combinational Circuits:
These circuits are developed using AND, OR, NOT, NAND, and NOR logic gates. These logic gates are building blocks of combinational circuits. A combinational circuit consists of input variables and output variables. Since these circuits are not dependent upon previous input to generate any output, so are combinational logic circuits. A combinational circuit can have an n number of inputs and m number of outputs. In combinational circuits, the output at any time is a direct function of the applied external inputs.
##Sequential circuits:
A sequential circuit is specified by a time sequence of inputs, outputs, and internal states. The output of a sequential circuit depends not only on the combination of present inputs but also on the previous outputs. Unlike combinational circuits, sequential circuits include memory elements with combinational circuits. Examples are Flipflops i.e., S R Flipflop, J K Flipflop, T-Flipflop and D-Flipflops.
