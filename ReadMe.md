# Verilog HDL Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of **basic to intermediate Verilog HDL implementations** written and tested as part of my personal learning and practice. The focus here is to build a solid understanding of digital logic design through hands-on coding.

> 💡 All code is written in Verilog and organized into thematic folders such as behavioral modeling, memories, and sequential circuits. These implementations can be synthesized or simulated using tools like **Xilinx ISE**, **ModelSim**, or **Vivado**.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

### 🔹 Behavioral Modelling
Includes practice code that demonstrates how **procedural blocks** (`always`, `initial`) and **control structures** (`if`, `case`, etc.) work in Verilog.

- `Always_Block.v` – Demonstrates combinational/sequential logic using `always` blocks.
- `Initial_Block.v` – Sample code showing initialization logic and test setups.
- `Event_Control.v` – Explores event-based timing controls (`posedge`, `@`, etc.).

### 🔹 Memories
Practice implementations focusing on memory initialization and basic memory modules.

- `Initializing_Arrays.v` – Simple examples of using arrays in Verilog.
- `Instruction_Memory.v` – An instruction memory model using Verilog arrays.

### 🔹 Sequential Circuits
Work on **clock-driven circuits** like flip-flops, counters, and state machines.

- This section is intended to contain modules like JK Flip-Flops, D Flip-Flops, FSMs, etc.
- Placeholder files exist for future examples and lab tasks.

## 🔧 Getting Started

To test or simulate any of the modules:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open your preferred Verilog simulator (Xilinx ISE, ModelSim, etc.)
3. Add the `.v` files from any directory
4. Write a test bench (if not already included)
5. Run simulation and observe outputs or waveforms

## 📌 Notes

- All modules are standalone and self-explanatory through naming.
- Comments are added wherever necessary for readability.
- This repository is a **work in progress**, and more modules will be added regularly.
